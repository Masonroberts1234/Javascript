        <p> Ever since Grecian times, people have been extrapolating ways to duplicate the intellect of the human mind.
            In <strong>Ancient Greek Mythology</strong>, the god Hephaestus is said to have created mechanical servants
            that walked and talked just like humans. Philosophers planted the seeds, talking about how the brain works
            and how we think, as the whole idea for <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> is that the human mind can be mechanized.
            Some two zero zero zero years ago, the <strong>abacus</strong>, a calculation device, was created.

            In pre-modern times, <strong>Charles Babbage</strong> created the first mechanical <strong>computer</strong>
            . This mechanical contraption counts as a computer because it had input, output, and a processor, and it did
            not need a human to calculate. In the one eight six zeros, Herman Hollerith actually built one of the
            world’s first practical calculating machine. It was an <strong>analog computer</strong>, which is not as
            flexible as the modern computers of today.

            In modern times, The first recorded Idea for <strong>digital computing</strong> was in the one nine three
            one paper <strong>"The Use of Thermatron’s for High Speed Automatic Counting of Physical Phenomena"</strong>
            by C. E. Wynn-Williams. <strong>Claude Shannon</strong>'s one nine three eight paper <strong>"A Symbolic
            Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits"</strong> then introduced the idea of using electronics for
            <strong>Boolean</strong> algebraic operations. independently in Germany and around the USA there were
            similar ideas. The one nine three seven Atanasoff-­Berry computer design was the first digital electronic
            computer (though not programmable), and the Zthree computer from one nine four one, by German inventor
            <strong>Konrad Zuse</strong> was the first working, programmable, fully automatic, computing machine. In the one nine <four></four>
            zeros, a collection of scientists from the mathematics, psychology, engineering, economics, and political
            science fields, began to think about developing an artificial brain. The field of artificial intelligence
            research was founded as an academic discipline in one nine five six. The research into <strong>thinking
            machines</strong> was inspired by a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late three zeros,
            four zeros, and early five zeros.

            Recently, research in neurology had shown that the brain was an electrical network of neurons that fired in
            all or nothing pulses. Coincidentally, digital signals are all or nothing pulses, (ones and zeros).

            In the future, who knows? Perhaps artificial intelligence will take over the world. Or, perhaps,
            artificially intelligent robots will become our companions and children. Perhaps we will be able to download
            our intelligences to robotic bodies!
